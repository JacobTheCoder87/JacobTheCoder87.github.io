          <td>In this Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability project we are tasked with analyzing a person's ability to repay their loans with little to no credit history. This way people who have been traditionally denied from a loan based on their credit history has a chance to still take out a loan. This is a group project between Carlos Martinez Abrego, Jacob Lam and Ramon Mora.</td>

          <td>In this project, we are analyzing a large dataset for financial banking transactions. Our goal is to identify and flag as many fradulent cases as possible, while minimizing false positives as much as we can. The challenge of this project is the class imbalance of our dataset, where there would be an overwhelmingly more non-fraudulent transactions than there are fradulent.</td>
